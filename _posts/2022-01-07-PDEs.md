## The problem

$$\begin{equation} \tag{$\alpha$}\label{A}
u_t + u^2u_x = 0
\end{equation}$$  

$$\begin{equation} 
u(x,0) = sech(x)
\end{equation}$$ 

<!-- $$\begin{align}
&u_t + u^2u_x = 0 \\
&u(x,0) = sech(x)
\end{align}$$ -->

The PDE is not directly solveable via integration, so we will resort to the method of characteristics.
## GS and characteristics

It can be shown that the general solutions to a PDE of the form:

$$\begin{equation} \tag{1a}\label{eqn1}
u_t + c(u)u_x = 0
\end{equation}$$  

$$\begin{equation} \tag{1b}\label{ic}
u(x,0) = f(x)
\end{equation}$$

have solutions that adhere to the same form. 

Firstly, we can use the chain rule $$\frac{du}{dt} = u_t + \frac{dx}{dt}u_x$$. We can observe that it follows the form of $$\eqref{eqn1}$$ and hence: $$\frac{du}{dt} = 0 \Rightarrow u = w$$ , where w is a constant.    

Next, we use the parametrised method of characteristics to obtain the simultaneous equations:

$$\begin{equation} \tag{2a}\label{eqn3}
\frac{dt}{ds} = 1
\end{equation}$$  
$$\begin{equation} \tag{2b}\label{eqn4}
\frac{dx}{ds} = c(u)
\end{equation}$$ 

& from this we can show that: 

$$\begin{equation}
c(u)\frac{dt}{ds} \stackrel{c(u)\eqref{eqn3}=\eqref{eqn4}}= \frac{dx}{ds} 
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation} \tag{3}\label{eqn5}
x = c(u)t + \xi \implies x = c(w)t + \xi
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation} \tag{4}\label{eqn6}
\therefore u = w(\xi) \implies u=w(x-c(w)t)
\end{equation}$$

Note that the characteristics are given by the equation $$\eqref{eqn5}$$. Also note that at t = 0 we have that $$\eqref{eqn5}$$ turns into $$ x = \xi $$.

$$ u(x,0) = f(x) \implies w(x)=f(x) \implies w(\xi) = f(\xi)$$  
$$ \therefore u = f(x-tc(u)) $$. $$\eqref{eqn6}$$.

We can now summarise this. A PDE of the form $$u_t + c(u)u_x = 0$$ has the characteristics $$x = c(u)t + \xi$$ $$\eqref{eqn5}$$ and a general solution of the form $$u=f(\xi)=f(x-c(u)t)$$, which is a travelling wave solution.

## Back to the original problem
### Characteristics
Using $$\eqref{eqn5}$$, we can deduce that the characteristics for the original PDE $$\eqref{A}$$ is given by:

$$\begin{equation}
x = tsech^2(x) + \xi
\end{equation}$$

 The characteristics intersect, which tells us this is in fact a shock wave solution.

### At what point does the shock wave occur?
Without going into the proof, for a general equation $$\eqref{eqn1}$$ with initial condition $$\eqref{ic}$$, the point at which the shock wave occurs is given by the formulae:-

$$\begin{equation}
t_b = \frac{-1}{F'(\xi_b)}
\end{equation}$$  

$$\begin{equation}
x_b = \xi_b - \frac{F(\xi_b)}{F'(\xi_b)}
\end{equation}$$  

whereby  $$F(\xi) = c(f(\xi))$$ and we have $$\xi_b$$ s.t. $$ F''(\xi_b) = 0$$.


In our example:-  

$$\begin{equation}
F(\xi) = sech^2(\xi)
\end{equation}$$  
$$F'(\xi) = -2sech^2(\xi)tanh(\xi)$$  
$$\begin{align}
F''(\xi) &= 4sech^2(\xi)tanh^2(\xi)-2sech^2(\xi)(1-tanh^2(\xi)) \\
         &= 2sech^2(\xi)(3tanh^2(\xi)-1)
\end{align}$$  

Hence, $$F''(\xi_b) = 0$$ when $$3tanh^2(\xi_b) - 1 = 0$$. Taking the arctanh, we arrive at $$\xi_b = \pm 0.658478$$. By trying both values, we can arrive at the conclusion that we are only interested in the positive $$\xi_b$$ since it's the only one that gives us a $$t>0$$.  

$$\begin{align}
t_b &= \frac{1}{2sech^2(0.6585)tanh(0.6585)} \\
    &= 1.299
\end{align}$$  

$$\begin{align}
x_b &= 06585 + \frac{sech^2(\xi_b)}{2sech^2(\xi_b)tanh(\xi_b)} \\
    &= 1.5245
\end{align}$$

The shock wave occurs (1.5245,1.299). With about of adjustment to the previous maple code, it can be illustrated where the shockwave occurs.

### Back to the solution  
Although we could have skipped the analysis of the characteristics of the PDE altogether, we would not necessarily know why the solution is behaving the way it is, i.e. that it is a shockwave solution and the point at which it occurs exactly. If it was a standard tavelling wave, the solution $$u(x,t)$$ would have the same shape as t increases, since it would be travelling at a constant speed. However, this does not happen in this case as will be illustrated.  

We have $$ u = f(\xi) $$ and $$ \xi = x - tsech^2(\xi)$$.  
$$ u = (\xi) = sech(\xi) \implies \xi = x - u^2t $$  
$$\therefore u = f(\xi) = f(x-u^2t) = sech(x-u^2t)$$
